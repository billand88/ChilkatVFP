## Base

Base custom object.

The Base object contains a few methods and a property that are relevant for all subclasses. Developers can override/decorate the DisplayErrorMessage and ProcessErrorMessage methods in the iBase class.

The properties of the Base class are:

| Property | Purpose                        |
|----------|--------------------------------|
|cVersion| Property used to hold the version number of the project. Unused at this time. |


The methods of the Base class are :

| Method | Purpose                        |
|--------|--------------------------------|
|DisplayErrorMessage| Method run to display the error message. |
|ProcessErrorMessage| Method run to process an error message. |
|Release| Method run to cleanly release an object. |

## BaseChilkat

Template Chilkat class with properties/methods that span all Chilkat objects.

The lReturnBitAsLogical property potentially useful for interactive use. If the Chilkat property or method returns a Boolean value (0/1), setting this property to true will return a Visual Foxpro logical value (.f./.t.).

See the How Properties Work document on the usage of the cChilkatProperty and lWriteChilkatProperty properties.

## BaseEventHandler

As the time of this writing, Chilkat has 106 classes. ~~33~~ 39 of these classes contain events. This event handler class is the base handler for ~~27~~ 33 of those ~~33~~ 39 classes. The other six classes subclass from this base event handler and have even more events.

Note that for each Chilkat event there are four supporting methods in the event handler. For each Chilkat [*event*] there is a corresponding Event Handler [*event*], [*event name*]_pre, [*event name*]_process and [*event name*]_post methods. The event handler methods are "hooked". 

For reference, please read Steven Black's seminal work about the subject here: <a href="http://stevenblack.com/articles/hooks-and-anchors/" target="_blank">http://stevenblack.com/articles/hooks-and-anchors/</a>  

The four event handler classes can be used (or for that matter, ignored) any way you want. The intent is thus: 

| Method | Purpose                        |
|--------|--------------------------------|
|*event*| The "governor" of the support event methods. |
|*event*_pre| A pre-processing method. You can set up the environment here.  |
|*event*_process| The "work" is done in this method. |
|*event*_post| A post-processing method to update the environment as necessary. |

Think of the _pre as a Textbox **When** method and the _post as a Textbox **LostFocus** method and you wouldn't be far off at all. 

Do your setup in the _pre method (Do I have a file? Is the directory good? Etc.). 
Do your "real work" in the _process method.
If the "work" is done successfully, call the _post method to "report" the success, clean up, etc.

Why do it this way? Well, the individual pieces of the process can be their own hooks! Hooks can call hooks, etc. No need to repeat Steve's article here...

The methods of the BaseEventHandler class are:

| Method | Purpose                        |

|PercentDone_Post| Template PercentDone post-processing method. |
|PercentDone_Pre| Template PercentDone pre-processing method. |
|PercentDone_Process| Template PercentDone processing method. |
