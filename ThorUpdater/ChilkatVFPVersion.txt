# Release History

## 2025-05-21 Version 1.50

   1) Added ChilkatVFP.H with compile time switch. See Documentation/History.md for details.
   2) Compatibility with Chilkat version 11.0.0.
   3) Added code to test for removed classes/properties/methods.

## 2025-03-02 Version 1.43

- Compatibility with Chilkat version 10.1.3.

## 2025-02-14 Version 1.42

- Compatibility with Chilkat version 10.1.2.

## 2025-01-19 Version 1.41

- This is a bug fix version of the prior 1.40 release.

Fixed/adjusted for this version:

   1) Events can be set again.
   2) An additional CallBack*.PRG was added in 1.40, but never called. Fixed.
   3) Secrets class added to the list of Chilkat objects that can have an event handler.
   4) Removed the three deprecated properties/methods from the BaseChilkat class. Went through the framework to remove all references. At least two classes (One of them HTTPRequest) couldn't instantiate in version 1.40 without this fix.
   5) Added m. (m dot) prefixes to the BaseEventHandler class and subclasses.
   6) Other random fixes.

## 2025-01-14 Version 1.40

First off: It turns out I need to change the name of the main library from Chilkat.VCX to ChilkatVFP.VCX. The reason why is explained in the Class Library Name Change.md document in the Documentation folder.

   1) There is a new Versioning object to do the new versioning calculations. 
   2) Added new Secrets class arriving in Chilkat version 10.1.0.
   3) Added the ability to support Chilkat class retirements coming in version 11. Added a MsgSvc record pertaining to class retirements.
   4) Changed all source code to support the new versioning.
   5) Found two classes that didn't get the "m." prefix for variables as described in Version 1.31 changes as well as other random missed methods.

## 2024-07-10 Version 1.34

Chilkat version 99 compatibility release.

Also added the enhancement/bug fix notes in the method documentation to the associated *ASync method if such a method existed.

## 2024-04-04 Version 1.33

  1) The MsgSvc program will be deprecated and replaced with ChMsgSvc.PRG.
  2) There's a new instance class property called cMsgSvcLanguage. This property references the MsgSvc.DBF field to retrieve for message displays. 
  3) Chilkat version 98 support. 
  4) New document in the Documentation folder, "Using the Chilkat Class Library". This document goes over some solutions for implementing a language change within ChilkatVFP.

## 2024-02-13 Version 1.32

  1) Chilkat Version 97 compatibility.
  2) Fixed code bugs and documentation bugs when I ran into them
  3) The LogicalToBit method was fixed.
  4) Added lots of documentation within the instance classes.	
  5) Added the ChilkatChangeLog method to all instance classes to serve as historical documentation.

## 2024-01-20 Version 1.31

 1) Added "m." (mdots) to all the memory variables within Chilkat.VCX where necessary.
 2) The StringTable, BinData and IMAP classes didn't even compile cleanly. Fixed.
 3) The SFTP event handling within the three ChilkatVFPEventCallbacks programs didn't have the extended events. Fixed.

## 2023-11-15 Version 1.3

 1) Version 96 compatibility changes. 
 2) This update includes the new DNS/iDNS classes in Chilkat.VCX/iChilkat.VCX. 
 3) ChilkatVFPEventCallbacks.PRG gets three new event procedures. 
 4) Fixes and enhancements to the documentation.
 5) Found about a dozen or so missing ChilkatVFP methods and properties between Chilkat versions 90 - 95. 

## 2023-10-13 Version 1.24

- Found several additional Chilkat classes that lacked a Version property (and thereby couldn't instantiate correctly in ChilkatVFP).

Added a TaskDownloadTest program to demonstrate very basic tasking. 

## 2023-08-24 Version 1.23

- Finished off compatibility changes for Chilkat version 95. Added one version 96 method.

## 2023-07-18 Version 1.22

 1) Added iChilkat.VCT/VCX which subclasses the iBaseChilkat instance classes. 
 2) The cEventHandler class was set incorrectly for several classes, now fixed.
 3) The SpiderTest program was updated.

## 2023-07-18 Version 1.21

- Chilkat version 94 compatibility and a couple of minor fixes.

## 2023-04-19 Version 1.2

 1) You can now pass a ChilkatVFP object as an object parameter to a Chilkat method.
 2) calling properties (and presumably methods) before their implementation would simply fail, now you are told why they failed.

## Version 1.11

- Bug fix version.

 1) You could not instantiate the BinData or the StringBuilder class, now fixed.
 2) Enhanced/tweaked/adjusted a few methods in the BaseChilkat class.
 3) Addded events to ChilkatVFPEventCallbacks.PRG.

## 2022-11-04 Version 1.1

 1) Added support for all Chilkat event callbacks. See the How Events Work.md document in the Documentation folder.
 2) Added the cEventHandlerClass, lAddEventHandler and oEventHandler properties to the BaseChilkat class. 
 3) Added the BaseEventHandler class and about a dozen subclasses to support Chilkat event callbacks.
 4) ChilkatVFPEventCallbacks.PRG, ChilkatVFPEventCallbacksPreV52.PRG and ChilkatVFPEventCallbacksPreV58.PRG are added to support Chilkat event callbacks. 
 5) SpiderTest.PRG included as a Chilkat event implementation example.
 6) A couple SleepMs methods were not working correctly are fixed in this version.
